  "prompt": "I want to make an android app that shows verses of surah in the last Juz of the Holy Quran. It should incorporate data from a well known github repo for the surah definitions so we don't fall into hallucinations.  The main feature is that the app should be controllable by bluetooth devices to show next of previous verse. It should only show one verse at a time in the screen for readability. In the inital screen the user should be able to pick any surah to start.",
